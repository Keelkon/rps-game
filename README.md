# Rock Paper Scissors Project - The Odin Project, Foundations

This project is the first project in the JavaScript unit of the Foundations course. The requirements are to create a game within the Console of a webpage, with JavaScript programming, where a user can play against a computer player in a game of Rock Paper Scissors. 

The game must allow the user to enter a choice between the three options. The program should then output the answer of the computer and whether the user won or lost based on the randomly selected choice of the computer. 

The project instructions note that the GUI (any creation or styling of an actual interface on the webpage) will be done in a later project or lesson. For now the game will be played solely in the console. 

## My Goals Prior to Compeletion

I have found doing these before and after thoughts for the projects helps me understand a bit more of where I am at in my learning so I plan to continue them here. 

### My goals for this project are:
* Work on creating basic functions. 
* Getting comfortable with the different conditionals and figuring out which ones might fit the current problem best. 
* Practice with creating variables and understanding the scope of them. 
* Utilizing the Problem Solving practices that were taught in the JS Unit to work through the project.
* Using the Dev Tools to work through bugs/errors in the code.
* Overall getting comfortable with programming and using JavaScript. 

Learning JS has definitely been the most challenging part of the course for me so far. It is the most different from anything I have ever done or dealt with in my past and has forced me to work on how I think more than anything else. I have enjoyed learning it so far but there are many more moments of compelete confusion and feelings of brain dead than I had experienced with either HTML or CSS. 

I must admit that creating this project and staring at the blank JS file is very intimidating and I already feel a bit lost. But my experience with the other projects has shown me that taking my time and working through it bit by bit will instill confidence and definitely cement the foundational understanding of the lessons I have learned so far. 

## After Thoughts:

This project was very daunting initially and there are still parts of the completed code I am a little confused on. I have used Google and other resources to try and help me understand better the things I was missing. I do feel better about those areas and overall how to tackle a project like this. I think the problem solving techniques were really quite useful and helped me through all the moments I felt completely lost. 

If I am being honest with myself and my progress, I think I would still need quite a bit of help to do this project from scratch again. However, I have a way better understanding of the syntax but most importantly how a project like this is tackled and put together. Which to me is great progress for myself. Learning about functions, variables and conditionals is one thing but actually putting them all together in an actual real world project and how they interact with eachother is a whole other challenge. 

Throughout the whole course and even other resources online I have seen all really emphasize working on projects to learn code and programming. I have already understood this and how truthful that advice really is from the prior projects but this one was on a whole other level. 

For example, in the project I had to write a function that would determine the outcome between the choices made between the two players. I had no idea truly where to begin. I intially tried basic if/else if statements. Which was along the right idea but when it came time to figure out how to determine all the outcomes for who wins vs who loses, I was lost. Using some resources I was able to figure it out and learned and ended up using && (AND) and || (OR) operators. Which of course was covered befoer this project but was an example of actually using the basic knoweledge in a real world example. I still think I will forget when/how to use those in a future project but I do feel a bit better about my understanding of them and their purpose and usefulness. 

I am very proud of myself for completing this project. As I mentioned before JS was really intimidating to me and still sort of is. I know there is much more to learn and way more complexity ahead of me. But this was a great first step and instilled some more confidence in my ability to grasp this stuff. I am already thinking of personal projects I would like to do after I complete this course. However, I want to focus on the course and do my best to learn the foundations to help me when I am attempting those personal projects first.
