# Rock Paper Scissors Project - The Odin Project, Foundations

This project is the first project in the JavaScript unit of the Foundations course. The requirements are to create a game within the Console of a webpage, with JavaScript programming, where a user can play against a computer player in a game of Rock Paper Scissors. 

The game must allow the user to enter a choice between the three options. The program should then output the answer of the computer and whether the user won or lost based on the randomly selected choice of the computer. 

The project instructions note that the GUI (any creation or styling of an actual interface on the webpage) will be done in a later project or lesson. For now the game will be played solely in the console. 

## My Goals Prior to Compeletion

I have found doing these before and after thoughts for the projects helps me understand a bit more of where I am at in my learning so I plan to continue them here. 

### My goals for this project are:
* Work on creating basic functions. 
* Getting comfortable with the different conditionals and figuring out which ones might fit the current problem best. 
* Practice with creating variables and understanding the scope of them. 
* Utilizing the Problem Solving practices that were taught in the JS Unit to work through the project.
* Using the Dev Tools to work through bugs/errors in the code.
* Overall getting comfortable with programming and using JavaScript. 

Learning JS has definitely been the most challenging part of the course for me so far. It is the most different from anything I have ever done or dealt with in my past and has forced me to work on how I think more than anything else. I have enjoyed learning it so far but there are many more moments of compelete confusion and feelings of brain dead than I had experienced with either HTML or CSS. 

I must admit that creating this project and staring at the blank JS file is very intimidating and I already feel a bit lost. But my experience with the other projects has shown me that taking my time and working through it bit by bit will instill confidence and definitely cement the foundational understanding of the lessons I have learned so far.
